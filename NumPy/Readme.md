# 🧮 NumPy - Numerical Python

## 📖 Overview
**NumPy (Numerical Python)** is the core library for scientific and data analysis tasks in Python.  
It provides high-performance tools for working with **arrays**, **matrices**, and performing **mathematical operations** efficiently.

NumPy enables fast computation, compact memory usage, and vectorized operations — making it the backbone of libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-learn**.
