## 🧱 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Array Creation
- Creating arrays from lists  
- Using built-in functions like `zeros()`, `ones()`, `arange()`, `linspace()`

### 🔹 Array Attributes
- Understanding `shape`, `ndim`, `dtype`, `size`, `itemsize`

### 🔹 Indexing & Slicing
- Accessing elements in 1D and 2D arrays

### 🔹 Mathematical Operations
- Vectorized addition, multiplication, and functions like `sqrt()` and `sum()`

### 🔹 Reshape & Transpose
- Changing array dimensions and orientations

### 🔹 Boolean Indexing
- Filtering arrays using conditions

### 🔹 Broadcasting
- Performing operations on arrays of different shapes
